    <h1>A fresh approach</h1>
    <p>The researchers argue that the way that earlier studies measured alcohol's 
        impact on
         health might be flawed. 
        Specifically, they note that the studies are generally observational and
         usually recruit 
        participants over the age of 50.

            The authors argue that this is problematic because it excludes anyone
             who might have
             died due to alcohol before the age of 50. As they dryly point out, 
             "Deceased persons cannot be enrolled in cohort studies."
            
            Dr. Naimi first outlined his concerns about this inherent selection bias in
             a paper published in the journal Addiction in 2017.</p>

        <p>The analysis showed that the level of an individual's alcohol-related 
            risk was heavily influenced by age.

                In total, 35.8 percent of alcohol-related deaths occurred in people aged
                 20â€“49. When looking at deaths that were prevented by alcohol consumption,
                  the scientists found only 4.5 percent in this age group.
                
                When they looked at individuals aged 65 or over, it was a different story: 
                Although a similar 35 percent of alcohol-related deaths occurred in this group,
                uthors found a huge 80 percent of the deaths prevented by alcohol in this
                 demographic.</p>
