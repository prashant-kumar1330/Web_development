            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
             It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
            at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
            ur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word
             in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
              comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et 
              Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
               This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during 
               the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor 
               sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is 
            reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
             1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are
              also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied
               by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
